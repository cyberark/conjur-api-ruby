## Development (V5)
To develop and run tests against Conjur V5, use the `start` and `stop` scripts in the `dev` folder. The start script brings up an open source Conjur (and Postgres database), CLI container, and a "work" container, with the gem code mounted into the working directory.

### Starting a Shell
To begin:
```sh
$ cd dev
$ ./start
...
root@9df0ac10ada2:/src/conjur-api#
```
You'll be dropped into development container upon completion. From there, install the development gems:

```sh
root@9df0ac10ada2:/src/conjur-api# bundle
```

#### Running Tests
*NOTE*: There are some existing challenges around running tests from the development console.  For now, run tests
by using the `./test.sh` script utilized for Jenkins Pipelines.

<!--
Commented out until I can get tests running locally

Tests can be run with:
```sh
root@9df0ac10ada2:/src/conjur-api# bundle exec cucumber features
root@9df0ac10ada2:/src/conjur-api# bundle exec rspec
```
-->

#### Stopping & Environment Cleanup
Once you're done, exit the shell, and stop the containers:

```sh
root@9df0ac10ada2:/src/conjur-api# exit
$ ./stop
```

## Development (V4)

The file `docker-compose.yml` is a self-contained development environment for the project.

### Starting

To bring it up, run:

```sh-session
$ docker compose build
$ docker compose up -d pg conjur_4 conjur_5
```

Then configure the v4 and v5 servers:

```sh-session
$ ./ci/configure_v4.sh
...
$ ./ci/configure_v5.sh
...
```

### Using

Obtain the API key for the v5 admin user:

```
$ docker compose exec conjur_5 rake 'role:retrieve-key[cucumber:user:admin]'
3aezp05q3wkem3hmegymwzz8wh3bs3dr6xx3y3m2q41k5ymebkc
```

The password of the v4 admin user is "secret".

Now you can run the client `dev` container:

```sh-session
$ docker compose run --rm dev
```

This gives you a shell session with `conjur_4` and `conjur_5` available as linked containers.

### Demos

For a v5 demo, run:

```sh-session
$ bundle exec ./example/demo_v5.rb <admin-api-key>
```

For a v4 demo, run:

```sh-session
$ bundle exec ./example/demo_v4.rb
```

### Stopping

To bring it down, run:

```sh-session
$ docker compose down
```

## Releasing

### Update the version and changelog

1. Create a new branch for the version bump.
1. Commit these changes - `Bump version to x.y.z` is an acceptable commit message - and open a PR
   for review. Your PR should include updates to `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Add a git tag

1. Once your changes have been **reviewed and merged into main**, tag the version
   using `git tag -a "vx.y.z" -m "vx.y.z release"`. Note this requires you to be able to sign releases.
   Consult the [github documentation on signing commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/)
   on how to set this up. `vx.y.z release` is an acceptable tag message.
1. Push the tag: `git push vx.y.z` (or `git push origin vx.y.z` if you are working
   from your local machine).

After pushing the tag, a matching version will be published to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/conjur-api/versions)!
