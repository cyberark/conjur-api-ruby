module Conjur

  # This module provides methods for things that have an associated {Conjur::Role}.
  #
  # All high level Conjur assets (groups and users, for example) are composed of both a role and a resource.  This allows
  # these assets to have permissions on other assets, and for other assets to have permission
  # on them.
  #
  # The {Conjur::ActsAsRole} module itself should be considered private, but it's methods are
  # public when added to a Conjur asset class.
  module ActsAsRole
    
    # Login name of the role. This is formed from the role kind and role id.
    # For users, the role kind can be omitted.
    def login
      [ kind, identifier ].delete_if{|t| t == "user"}.join('/')
    end

    # Check whether this object exists by performing a HEAD request to its URL.
    #
    # This method will return false if the object doesn't exist.
    #
    # @example
    #   does_not_exist = api.user 'does-not-exist' # This returns without error.
    #
    #   # this is wrong!
    #   owner = does_not_exist.members # raises RestClient::ResourceNotFound
    #
    #   # this is right!
    #   owner = if does_not_exist.exists?
    #     does_not_exist.members
    #   else
    #     nil # or some sensible default
    #   end
    #
    # @return [Boolean] does it exist?

    # Find all roles of which this role is a member.  By default, role relationships are recursively expanded,
    # so if `a` is a member of `b`, and `b` is a member of `c`, `a.all` will include `c`.
    #
    # ### Permissions
    # You must be a member of the role to call this method.
    #
    # You can restrict the roles returned to one or more role ids.  This feature is mainly useful
    # for checking whether this role is a member of any of a set of roles.
    #
    # ### Options
    #
    # * **recursive** Defaults to +true+, performs recursive expansion of the memberships.
    #
    # @example Show all roles of which `"conjur:group:pubkeys-1.0/key-managers"` is a member
    #   # Add alice to the group, so we see something interesting
    #   key_managers = api.group('pubkeys-1.0/key-managers')
    #   key_managers.add_member api.user('alice')
    #
    #   # Show the memberships, mapped to the member ids.
    #   key_managers.role.all.map(&:id)
    #   # => ["conjur:group:pubkeys-1.0/admin", "conjur:user:alice"]
    #
    # @example See if role `"conjur:user:alice"` is a member of either `"conjur:groups:developers"` or `"conjur:group:ops"`
    #   is_member = api.role('conjur:user:alice').all(filter: ['conjur:group:developers', 'conjur:group:ops']).any?
