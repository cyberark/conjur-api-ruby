module Conjur

  # Protected (secret) data stored in Conjur.
  # 
  # The code responsible for the actual encryption of variables is open source as part of the
  # {https://github.com/conjurinc/slosilo Slosilo} library.
  #
  # Each variables has some standard metadata (`mime-type` and secret `kind`).
  #
  # Variables are *versioned*.  Storing secrets in multiple places is a bad security practice, but
  # overwriting a secret accidentally can create a major problem for development and ops teams.  Conjur
  # discourages bad security practices while avoiding ops disasters by storing previous versions of
  # a secret (up to a fixed limit, to avoid unbounded database growth).
  #
  # ### Important
  # A common pitfall when trying to access older versions of a variable is to assume that `0` is the oldest
  # version.  Variable versions are `1`-based, with `1` being the oldest.
  #
  # ### Permissions
  #
  # * To *fetch* the value of a `variable`, you must have permission to `'execute'` the variable.
  # * To *add* a value to a `variable`, you must have permission to `'update'` the variable.
  # * To *show* metadata associated with a variable, but *not* the value of the secret, you must have `'read'`
  #     permission on the variable.
  #
  # @example Get a variable and access its metadata and the latest value
  #   variable = api.resource 'myorg:variable:example'
  #   puts variable.kind      # "example-secret"
  #   puts variable.mime_type # "text/plain"
  #   puts variable.value     # "supahsecret"

  # @example Variables are versioned
  #   variable = api.resource 'myorg:variable:example'
  #   # Unless you set a variables value when you create it, the variable starts out without a value and version_count
  #   # is 0.
  #   var.version_count # => 0
  #   var.value # raises RestClient::ResourceNotFound (404)
  #
  #   # Add a value
  #   var.add_value 'value 1'
  #   var.version_count # => 1
  #   var.value # => 'value 1'
  #
  #   # Add another value
  #   var.add_value 'value 2'
  #   var.version_count # => 2
  #
  #   # 'value' with no argument returns the most recent value
  #   var.value # => 'value 2'
  #
  #   # We can access older versions by their 1 based index:
  #   var.value 1 # => 'value 1'
  #   var.value 2 # => 'value 2'
  #   # Notice that version 0 of a variable is always the most recent:
  #   var.value 0 # => 'value 2'
  #

    # returning the value of a variable.  Conjur applies the same MIME Type to all versions of a variable,
    # so if you plan on accessing the variable in a way that depends on a correct `Content-Type` header
    # you should make sure to store appropriate data for the mime type in all versions.

    # Return the version of a variable.
    #
    # You must have the **`'execute'`** permission on a variable to call this method.
    #
    # When no argument is given, the most recent version is returned.
    #
    # When a `version` argument is given, the method returns a version according to the following rules:
    #  * If `version` is 0, the *most recent* version is returned.
    #  * If `version` is less than 0 or greater than {#version_count}, a `RestClient::ResourceNotFound` exception
    #   will be raised.
    #  * If {#version_count} is 0, a `RestClient::ResourceNotFound` exception will be raised.
    #  * If `version` is >= 1 and `version` <= {#version_count}, the version at the **1 based** index given by `version`
    #    will be returned.
    #
    # @example Fetch all versions of a variable
    #   versions = (1..var.version_count).map do |version|
    #     var.value version
    #   end
    #
    # @example Get the current version of a variable
    #   # All of these return the same thing:
    #   var.value
    #   var.value 0
    #   var.value var.version_count
    #
    # @example Get the value of an expired variable
    #   var.value nil, show_expired: true
    #
    # @param [Integer] version the **1 based** version.
    # @param options [Hash]
    # @option options [Boolean, false] :show_expired show value even if variable has expired
    # @return [String] the value of the variable
