    # * POLICY_METHOD_POST Policy data will be added to the named policy. Deletions are not allowed.

    # are performed by an explicit `!delete` statement.
    # * POLICY_METHOD_PUT The policy completely replaces the name policy. Policy data which is present
    # in the server, but not present in the new policy definition, is deleted.
